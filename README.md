This repository is the final project for class ML2324T1. Its is a analysis of prices of houses in Setapak Area. 
# Final Machine Learning Project

## Overview

This project encompasses a comprehensive machine learning pipeline, demonstrating data preprocessing, analysis, modeling, and evaluation. It's designed to showcase the application of various machine learning techniques and algorithms on a dataset to achieve specific objectives. The project is implemented in a Collab Notebook and leverages several popular Python libraries for data analysis and machine learning.  The links for Collab and the Youtube video explaining our works is below.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for the project.
- **NumPy**: For efficient numerical computations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning and predictive data analysis.
- **Imbalanced-learn**: For dealing with imbalanced data.
- **Statsmodels**: For estimating and interpreting models for statistical analysis.
- **Google Colab/Google Sheets (gspread)**: For online data storage and processing (assuming from the 'google' and 'gspread' libraries).

## Setup Instructions

To run this project, you'll need to have Python installed on your system along with the aforementioned libraries. You can install these libraries using pip:
