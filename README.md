# ML2324T1_Project
This repository is the final project for class ML2324T1. Its is a analysis of prices of houses in Setapak Area. 
Final Machine Learning Project
Project Overview
This project encompasses a comprehensive machine learning pipeline, demonstrating data preprocessing, analysis, modeling, and evaluation. It's designed to showcase the application of various machine learning techniques and algorithms on a dataset to achieve specific objectives. The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and leverages several popular Python libraries for data analysis and machine learning.

Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language used for the project.
NumPy: For efficient numerical computations.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning and predictive data analysis.
Imbalanced-learn: For dealing with imbalanced data.
Statsmodels: For estimating and interpreting models for statistical analysis.
Google Colab/Google Sheets (gspread): For online data storage and processing (assuming from the 'google' and 'gspread' libraries).
Setup Instructions
To run this project, you'll need to have Python installed on your system along with the aforementioned libraries. 

You can install these libraries using pip:
bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn sklearn imblearn statsmodels gspread
If you're using Google Colab, most of these libraries come pre-installed, and you can install any missing ones directly in your notebook.

Execution Instructions
To execute the project:

Open the Final_ML_Submission.ipynb notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab.
Ensure all the required libraries are installed.
Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to see the data analysis, model building, and evaluation process.
Customizing the Project
Feel free to customize the analysis and models as per your dataset and objectives. You can also tweak the visualizations to better suit your presentation needs.
